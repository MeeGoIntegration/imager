Requirements
------------

Imager can be deployed a single "appliance" or in a distributed, multi worker fashion.
The UI part can be deployed to a small machine or VM, while each worker that
does the actual image building needs at least 1Gb of RAM and 8GB of disk space.

An already existing BOSS installation is expected to be accesible. For
instructions on deploying BOSS refer to: http://wiki.meego.com/Release_Infrastructure/BOSS/Installation

The installation of the UI includes a web server and a mysql server for django.
