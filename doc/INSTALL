Requirements
------------

Imager can be deployed a single "appliance" or in a distributed, multi worker fashion.
The UI part can be deployed to a small machine or VM, while each worker that
does the actual image building needs at least 1Gb of RAM and 8GB of disk space.

The installation of the UI requires a web server and a mysql server. Any webserver that
can talk to fastcgi script can be used. Apache, lighttpd and nginx all work fine.

Debian Squeeze
--------------

Add the correct repository ::

 cat >> /etc/apt/sources.list.d/mint_testing.list << EOF
 deb http://repo.pub.meego.com/Project:/MINT:/Testing/Debian_6.0/ /
 EOF
 apt-get update

UI only ::
  
 apt-get install img-web

Worker only ::

 apt-get install img-ks img-worker

.. note::
   If you are going to serve the built images directly from the workers install
   an HTTP server as well. Refer to worker configuration for more details

UI + Worker ::

 apt-get install img-web img-ks img-worker

Everything ( aka appliance )::

 apt-get install boss img-web img-ks img-worker 

Don't forget to install an HTTP server

OpenSUSE

Add the correct repository. For openSUSE 11.4 ::

 zypper ar http://repo.pub.meego.com/Project:/MINT:/Testing/openSUSE_11.4/Project:MINT:Testing.repo

For openSUSE 12.1 ::

 zypper ar http://repo.pub.meego.com/Project:/MINT:/Testing/openSUSE_12.1/Project:MINT:Testing.repo

UI only ::

 zypper --non-interactive in img-web 

Worker only ::
