IMGer : Image Me Give
========================
IMG (Image Me Give) is a small python client/server application suite, its sole 
job is to get a kickstart file from a user, via a web interface, command line 
or BOSS process. Then it runs Moblin-Image-Creator, either in a host or in a 
VM. IMG also has the capability to run as a BOSS participant and thus be a 
part of a build process.
