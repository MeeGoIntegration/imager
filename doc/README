MeeGo-IMG : Image Me Get
========================
IMG (Image Me Give) is a small python client/server application suite, its sole
job is to get a POST'd kickstart file from a user and then run Moblin-Image-Creator. 
It is also possible to use kickstarter yaml files to create a tailor-made image or 
using the default selection of yaml templates.
